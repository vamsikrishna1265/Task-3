The output of this application shows a simple Record Management System built entirely using HTML and CSS with JavaScript for interactivity. At the top of the page, there is a form where the user can enter a Name and an Email to create a new record. When the “Add Record” button is clicked, the information is immediately added to a table displayed below the form. This allows users to see the records they have created in real time.

The table displays all the records in three columns: Name, Email, and Action. The Action column contains a Delete button for each record. When this button is clicked, the corresponding record is removed instantly from the table. This provides a simple way to manage and maintain the list of records without needing to reload the page.

Above the table, there is a search input box that allows the user to filter records by name. As the user types into the search field, only the records that match the search term are displayed in the table. This feature helps users quickly locate a specific record among many entries and improves usability.

The application is designed using HTML for structure and CSS for styling. The layout is clean and easy to read, with clear form inputs, buttons, and table rows. The buttons are styled with colors and hover effects to make the interface more interactive. The spacing, borders, and font styling make the user interface user-friendly and visually appealing.
